Well, settle in. Before you were born, Mushroom Island and Candy Island were the best of friends. Travel and trade between the two were possible. One day, the leaders of the island had a falling out, and now we are not welcome on Candy Island any longer. That day was the day that the nature of our Mushroom Island lost its color.  /n Me: And I can fix it?   /n Witch: If you are brave enough to venture into Candy Island, you may be able to find the sorcerer who cast our worlds into disrepair. Perhaps then you can change his mind.");</script>
